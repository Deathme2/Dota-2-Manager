Week 1 question

So lets get started we are all fans of dota 2 and we all have high ambitions/standards for a game like this but we have to be realistic and start simple and work forwards so with that in mind we should start by deciding what engine we are going to make the game in? I myself have use a lot of unity but am open to using any other engine the other option is we program it ground up using java or c++? Tell me what you think?
